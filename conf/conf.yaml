# Configuration for the autogenerated rst tables of contents which are appended to the end of index.rst
rst_index_config:
  # Each toplevel variable defines one TOC group. Any subdirectories not in this
  # config will all be lumped together in one generic group. A file will only
  # ever be added to a single TOC. If you add the same directory to two
  # different TOC groups, files from that directory will be added only to the
  # TOC group which comes earlier in this list.
  - datasets:
      caption: "Datasets" # the caption which will be given to the group the
      # directories in the docs directory which should be included in this TOC.
      # This will add all .rst files in these subdirectories to the TOC in
      # alphabetical order. Will only look at direct subdirectories of docs. If
      # you have something like docs/one/two, and include "two" in the following
      # list, then nothing will be added to the toc.
