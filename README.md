Public documentation for the outputs of the STRANDS Project. 

This readme will guide you through the setup and use of a system which uses the
STRANDS packages. It is assumed that you have a system that is running Ubuntu
14.04.

# Installing ROS

The first step is to follow the instructions found at
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu. The full install of ROS with the
package `ros-indigo-desktop-full` should contain all the packages that are required.

# Installing STRANDS packages

https://github.com/strands-project-releases/strands-releases/wiki.

# Database

# Metric map

The creation of the metric map is done using ROS gmapping. The use of this
package will depend on the type of robot you have. This requires that you have
laser and odometry data being published to the ROS system.
