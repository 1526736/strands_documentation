[Witham Wharf](witham_wharf): RGB-D snapshots of eight locations collected by a mobile robot over the period of one year by the University of Lincoln. Data is described in: Krajnik et al., Long-Term Topological Localization for Service Robots in in Dynamic Environments using spectral maps, IROS 2014. (tkrajnik@lincoln.ac.uk) Alternative link: [Witham Wharf Dataset](https://strands.pdc.kth.se/public/Witham_Wharf_RGB-D_dataset/)

[Small office data sets](small_office): Kinect depth images every 5 seconds between April 2014 and May 2016. Data is provided by the University of Lincoln. This data is described in Krajnik et al., FROctomap: an efficient spatio-temporal environment representation, Advances in Autonomous Robotics Systems, 2014. (tkrajnik@lincoln.ac.uk)

[Meta rooms](meta_rooms): RGB-D data with registration over several days and places. (raambrus@kth.se)

[G4S meta rooms](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/owncloud/public.php?service=files&t=cee1ceb7fb49ad373288f1249b7ff48b&dir=%2FG4S_2014): RGB-D data 150 sweeps with 18 images per sweep. This data is not public. (c.j.c.burbridge@cs.bham.ac.uk)

### Activity Data Sets:

[LAD](https://dartportal.leeds.ac.uk/dataset/lad): The Leeds Activity Dataset--Breakfast (LAD--Breakfast) is currently composed of 15 annotated videos, representing five different people having breakfast or other simple meal; it is recorded within a lab setting, but is as realistic as possible (real food, eating and drinking). The videos were recorded using an ASUS Xtion PRO LIVE - RGB and Depth Sensor. The objects in the video were tracked using an OpenNI based tool created by our RACE project partner, the University of Aveiro (this data set has be co-created by RACE and STRANDS) and the ground truth provided makes reference to the objects tracked. The videos have been annotated with activities at various levels of complexity and abstraction to be selected, in order to build a hierarchy of activities. The videos were not scripted in detail: each person could choose what to eat or drink and when, and the objects he needed were on the table. The videos are quite varied in terms of duration, type and sequence of activities, number and type of visible objects. High level activities such as "preparing coffee" or "consuming meal" are composed of low level ones (e.g. "pickup kettle", "pour kettle", "putdown kettle").
