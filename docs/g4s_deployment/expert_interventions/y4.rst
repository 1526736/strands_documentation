-  Comments: Following the issue with the robot driver, the laser sensor
   which is on USB0 disappeared from the system - whether this was a
   side effect is not certain, but it occurred after the previous
   intervention. ``/var/log/kern.log`` shows the following
   line:\ ``Jan  3 12:54:15 betty kernel: [1739575.923191] ftdi_sio ttyUSB0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0``.
   This occurrence of the FTDI board crash happened approximately 20
   days after the previous boot of the system. This meant that it was
   impossible for the robot to move. Since the robot was not on the
   charging station, this resulted in all PCs shutting down once the
   battery was drained, leaving the robot disabled. I talked to Michael
   Chance at TSC today and got him to restart the robot, main and side
   PCs.
