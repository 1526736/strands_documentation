[[Individual Computer Setup]]
=============================

Make sure you accomplish the setup detailed on the "[[Individual
Computer Setup]]" page prior to coming to Lincoln.

As we'll be working in teams, it is recommended to have a
`github.com <https://github.com/>`__ account. This will help you to
obtain the tutorial material and to collaborate with your team.

[[Working with the STRANDS robots]]
===================================

Programme
=========

The `school's
programme <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nEpX0Xc6jtl5pbOWdZbIe5l36X_87pChJPEqpAbDcbg/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true>`__
is composed of morning research presentations by leading academics in
their fields, followed by hands-on programming tutorials to get to know
the software components being used to program the robots. The afternoons
are dedicated to programming in teams to solve tasks on the robot during
the course of the summer school. In these teams of 6-7 you will be
working with one of four mobile Scitos G5 platform, equipped with two
Kinect sensors, SICK Laser Scanner, Touch screen, pan-tilt camera,
speakers, microphone, an actuated head for human-robot interaction, and
a differential drive to go about.

You will be working together in the team to implement one of a number of
[[possible tasks]] (in C++ or Python), cumulating in the opportunity to
present your achievements and yourself to the participants of the ECMR
conference during a dedicated poster and demonstration session at the
ECMR welcome reception.

Day 1 - 27/8: Mapping and Navigation
------------------------------------

-  Learning Objectives for the day:

1. Understanding basics and creation of metric and topological mapping
2. Get to know the challenges and solution of 4D (i.e. temporal) mapping
3. Navigate in those maps
4. Understand, create, and visualise "meta rooms" to perceive the
   dynamic environment

-  Lecture materials 1: `Part
   1 <Robotic%20Mapping%20into%20the%20Fourth%20Dimension%20-%20Pt1.pdf>`__,
   `Part
   2 <Robotic%20Mapping%20into%20the%20Fourth%20Dimension%20-%20Pt2.pdf>`__
-  [[Tutorial materials 1]]
-  Social event: Pub quiz at the `tower
   bars <https://goo.gl/maps/S1gDL>`__ starting at 18.00. If you want to
   eat there as well, please arrive around 17.30 as their kitchen will
   close at 18.00.

-  [[Tutorial materials 3]]
-  Social event: Social dinner at the `Wig &
   Mitre <https://goo.gl/maps/MwOz6>`__ starting 19.00. The distance
   might seem short but includes a rather steep hill, please allow some
   extra time for that.

Day 4 - 30/8: People tracking and Activities
--------------------------------------------

-  Learning Objectives for the day:

1. using and customising the people tracker
2. using the qsr\_lib to generate QSRs of arbitrary objects offline
3. adding a new QSR to the qsr\_lib
4. understanding QTC and writing an online qtc creator for robot and a
   human

-  Hacking tasks:
-  creating a node that generates QRSs between people, or objects
-  creating your own QSR in the lbrary
-  `Lecture materials 4 <lecture4.pdf>`__
-  [[Tutorial materials 4]]
