This package provides a simple node that uses the pedestrian tracker
results from the strands\_perception\_people repository to follow the
closest person in front of the robot. In order to use it you have to run
scitos\_2d\_nav.launch from the scitos\_2d\_navigation repository with a
pre-recorded or empty map. After words run the
perception\_people\_launch people\_tracker\_no\_HOG.launch and this node
on the robot.
